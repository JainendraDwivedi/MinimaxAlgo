# Minimax Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the Minimax algorithm. The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in game theory and decision theory. It is commonly used in two-player games such as Tic Tac Toe, Chess, and Checkers.

The Minimax algorithm is based on the idea of minimizing the maximum possible loss. It works by recursively exploring all possible moves from the current state of the game and assigning a score to each possible outcome. The algorithm then selects the move that leads to the best possible outcome for the player.

The Minimax algorithm is often used in conjunction with a game tree, which is a tree that represents all possible moves and their outcomes. Each node in the tree represents a state of the game, and each edge represents a possible move. The leaves of the tree represent the final outcomes of the game.
